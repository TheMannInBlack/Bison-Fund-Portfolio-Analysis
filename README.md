# Bison-Fund-Portfolio-Analysis
This repository contains tools for use by the NDSU Bison Investment Fund VP of Investments


This project was created to increase the use of and interest in Python by executives of the Bison Fund. 

These tools should cut down on the time it takes to create portfolio presentations and allow for quick analysis of data. When finished,
these tools should allow for: automatic download of basic portfolio data, calculation of statistics, visualization, and presentation
creation.
